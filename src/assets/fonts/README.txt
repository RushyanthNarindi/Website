Download the Malvides webfont (WOFF2) from:
https://www.1001fonts.com/malvides-font.html

Place the file as:
  Malvides-Regular.woff2

The site CSS already references this path: ../assets/fonts/Malvides-Regular.woff2
If you prefer WOFF, also place Malvides-Regular.woff alongside the woff2 file.

After adding the font, refresh your local server to see the text logo update.
